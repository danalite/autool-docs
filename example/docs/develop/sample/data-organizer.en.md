## Quick Path for Shell Commands

There are many power command line tools that can help you manage your data. However, it is not easy to remember all the commands and their options.

AuTool provides a convenient way to organize your commands. You can store the frequently used commands in the YAML and invoke them from a popup window.

We use `Todo.txt` as a showcase. `Todo.txt` is a super lightweight command line tool to manage your TODo items in pure text file. We use AuTool APIs to create a GUI interface for `Todo.txt` and make it easier to use.
