## Usage

Simply run the script, and you will be prompted to select the format you want to convert to. For simplicity, we only implemented the conversion from `MOV` to `GIF` in this script. You can add more formats by modifying the script. In the GIF below, you can select the source files to be converted, the quality of the converted files, and also FPS (frames per second) of the converted GIFs.

Fun fact: all the GIFs in this documentation are generated using this script.
