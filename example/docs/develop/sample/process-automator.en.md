## Browser Privacy

Sometimes you may want to use proxy to hide your IP address, or use a ToR network to hide your identity. AuTool can help you protect your privacy by automatically switching proxy settings for you.

## Knowledge Subscription

Want to use fragmentation time to learn new knowledge? You can use AuTool to subscribe to your favorite RSS feeds, and read them in your spare time. You can also schedule the script so that it will prompt you the knowledge you want to learn at a specific time.

The knowledge can be anything, like news, articles, or even your own notes. This example shows a French vocabulary flash cards. You can modify the script to change the flash cards to your own notes.

## Custom Form Builder

Finding it hard to get data from your friends or colleagues? You can use AuTool to create a simple form and send it to your friends. When they fill in the form, the data will be sent to your email or cloud storage.

Your friend or colleague does not need to install AuTool to fill in the form. They can use any browser to fill in the form.
