# Web Automation

Web automation is one of the most common use cases for AuTool. You can use AuTool script's [web operations](../scripts/web) to automate your web browser. Here are some examples:

## Auto-Fill Form

Importing an excel form into an online data table is a common task, but it is not always easy, especially when the web page does not provide an import function. AuTool can help you automate this process by a simple script.

We provide an example script to realize. Once you copy the data from an excel file, you can go to the target web page and hit the predefined hotkey. The script will then automatically separate the data and fill it into the web page.

## Browser Privacy

Sometimes you may want to use proxy to hide your IP address, or use a ToR network to hide your identity. AuTool can help you protect your privacy by automatically setting up the proxy for your browser. The only thing you need to do is to run the script, and start browsing as usual.

Here is an example of using AuTool script to set up a ToR proxy for your browser. Your actual IP address will be hidden behind the proxy server. You can modify the script to use other proxy services.

# Workflow Automation

AuTool can also help you automate your workflow and improve your productivity. Here are some examples:

## Knowledge Subscription

Want to use fragmentation time to learn new knowledge? You can use AuTool to subscribe to your favorite RSS feeds, and read them in your spare time. You can also schedule the script so that it will prompt you the knowledge you want to learn at a specific time.

The knowledge can be anything, like news, articles, or even your own notes. This example shows a French vocabulary flash cards. You can modify the script to change the flash cards to your own notes, or add audio components.

## Custom Form Builder

Finding it hard to get data from your friends or colleagues? You can use AuTool to create a simple form and send it to your friends. When they fill in the form, the data will be sent to your email or cloud storage.

Your friend or colleague does not need to install AuTool to fill in the form. They can use any browser to fill in the form.
