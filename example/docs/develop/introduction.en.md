AuTool is a desktop extension system that brings the convenience of browser plugins to your desktop. You can use AuTool to streamline your daily tasks, automate your workflows, or create your own work assistant.

The design principle of AuTool is to make it easy to automate, easy to develop, and easy to share. You can develop a plugin for your custom needs in minutes, and share it with your friends with a simple link. Each plugin is a simple YAML file with a few lines of code that defines the automation steps. There is no need to download a bunch of apps with bunch of sub-features you do not use at all to get things done.
