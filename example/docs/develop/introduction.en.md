Welcome to AuTool - an AI-powered workflow automation platform, which is fully open-source and free to use.

# What is AuTool?

AuTool provides an easy-to-use platform for automating repetitive tasks, optimizing workflows, and integrating AI technologies into your desktop environment. With AuTool, you can streamline your workflow, reduce errors, and increase efficiency, all while leveraging the latest AI technologies to augment your capabilities.

# Why AuTool?

## Integrate AI into Workflows

AuTool seamlessly integrates AI technologies into your desktop environment, allowing you to speedup your workflow with AI powers. Here is two quick workflow examples defined with AuTool scripts:

- Summarize PDFs using GPT: select a PDF file from disk, and its content is automatically summarized by GPT model.

- [Segment images using SAM](sample/image-segmentation): click on an image to select area of interest.

<table align="center" style="width:1000px">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Summarize PDFs using GPT</th>
      <th align="center">Segment Image using SAM</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding:10px"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danalite/awesome-autool-scripts/master/danalite/Mini-Tools/Summarize-PDFs/summary-pdf.gif" style="width:500px;max-width:500px" /></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We host a variety of state-of-the-art AI models on our server, and you can easily integrate them into your workflows with AuTool scripts. AuTool also provides a set of [pre-built AI-powered workflows](sample/overview) to help you get started.

## AI-Generated Workflows

AI has been used to generate art and text, why not workflows? Image that you can have an AI assistant to do the repetitive things for you, like [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), but with more human control and reliability. As an example, we ask GPT model to generate a workflow to handle customer support tickets (left). Each blue box is a fully automated stage, while the orange box is a checkpoint where human decision is required to proceed (right).
