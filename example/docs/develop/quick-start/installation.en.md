We recommend you to use DMG for installation. After dragging the app into the Applications folder, you should enter the Applications folder and open AuTool by right-clicking the app icon and selecting `Open`.

Accessibility permission is required before you can use it. This window will pop up automatically when you start AuTool for the first time. Click `Open System Settings` and grant accessibility permission to AuTool.

If you accidentally close it, you can grant accessibility permission manually. You can restart it by going to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility` and add AuTool to the list.
