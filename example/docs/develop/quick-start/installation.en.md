- **dmg**: It is a standard MacOS installer and will install AuTool to your `/Applications` folder.

### Grant Accessibility

You may need to grant AuTool accessibility permission to use some features. You can do so by going to `System Preferences` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility` and add AuTool to the list.

### Allow Unidentified App

As for now, AuTool is not yet added to Apple App Store, so you may see this warning when you run AuTool for the first time. You can simply click `Open Anyway` to run AuTool. AuTool is fully open-sourced, so please rest assured that AuTool is safe to use.
